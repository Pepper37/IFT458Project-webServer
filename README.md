# IFT458Project-webServer

Repo for my Project for IFT 458 at Arizona State University
The project will be an introduction to a full stack web server using minimal project requirements
The repo is split into different folders for each deliverable, I might make it more consistent once the class is all over

Derek Banas's video on MySQL and his freely provided "MySQL cheat sheet" were an immense help in recalling MySQL 
(his cheat sheet is included in the repo for my own reference)
